# DriverBehaviorMobileApp


Mobile devices are a valuable tool for reaching more people and serving the functionalities to more users in the applications being built. Hence we are building a gamification based mobile software to encourage good driver behavior.
Our vision is a world in which drivers are guided to drive safely beyond obeying traffic rules. To illustrate, the project is about scoring drivers according to vehicle usage patterns. Our application detects excessive acceleration, sends a warning and decrease total score at the same. In this sense, drivers’ behavior is influenced in order to collect a better score.
The system has been implemented using a software framework called OpenXC for component integration and achieves real-time scoring during the trip. The vehicle usage patterns are detected by vehicle sensors and converted to points in our Android application. Besides this application contains 'point of interest' (POI) feature that finds nearest preferred location and an emergency button which activates if the driver clicks and then it warns the driver’s relatives with a message on the smartphone screen.
